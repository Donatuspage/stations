        <p>V.	We adore thee, O Christ, and we praise thee.</p>
        <p>R.	Because by thy holy cross Thou hast redeemed the world.</p>

        <p>Consider how the holy woman named Veronica, seeing Jesus so ill-used, and bathed in sweat and blood, wiped His face with a towel, on which was left the impression of His holy countenance </p> 
        
        <p style="color: blue;">V.	Let us Kneel:</p>

        <p>My most beloved Jesus!, thy face was beautiful before, but in this journey it has lost all its beauty and wounds and blood have disfigured it.Alas! My soul was once beautiful, when it received thy grace in baptism but I have disfigured it by my sins; thou alone my dearest redeemer can restore it to its formal beauty. Do it by thy passion, o Jesus</p>

    

        <p>I love thee, Jesus, my love above all things; I repent with my whole heart for having often thee. Never permit me to separate myself from thee again. Grant that I may love thee always; and then do with me what thou will.</p>

        <p>Our father. 	</p> <p>			Hail Mary. 		</p> <p>	Glory be to the Father</p>

        <p>V.	Have mercy on us oh lord,</p> 
        <p>R.	Have Mercy on us,</p>
        <p>V.	May the souls of all the faithful departed </p>
        <p>R.	Through the Mercies of God, Rest in Peace</p>
