        <p>V.	We adore thee, O Christ, and we praise thee.</p>
        <p>R.	Because by thy holy cross Thou hast redeemed the world.</p>

        <p>Consider the meeting of the son and the mother,which took place on this journey. Their looks became like so many arrows to wound those hearts which loved each other so tenderly. </p> 
        
        <p style="color: blue;">V.	Let us Kneel:</p>

        <p>My sweet Jesus, by the sorrow thou didst experience in this meeting, grant me the grace of a devoted love for thy holy mother. And thou, my queen who was overwhelmed with sorrow, obtain for me a continual and tender remembrance of the passionate of thy son.</h2>

        <p>I love thee, Jesus, my love above all things; I repent with my whole heart for having often thee. Never permit me to separate myself from thee again. Grant that I may love thee always; and then do with me what thou will.</h2>

        <p>Our father. 	</p> <p>			Hail Mary. 		</p> <p>	Glory be to the Father</p>

        <p>V.	Have mercy on us oh lord,</p> 
        <p>R.	Have Mercy on us,</p>
        <p>V.	May the souls of all the faithful departed </p>
        <p>R.	Through the Mercies of God, Rest in Peace</p>
