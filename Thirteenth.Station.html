        <p>V.	We adore thee, O Christ, and we praise thee.</p>
        <p>R.	Because by thy holy cross Thou hast redeemed the world.</p>

        <p>Consider how Jesus, after our lord had expired, two of his disciples Joseph and Nicodemus, took Him down from the Cross, and placed Him in the hands of his afflicted Mother who received him with unutterable tenderness and praised Him to her bosom.</p>
        
        <p style="color: blue;">V.	Let us Kneel:</p>

        <p>O mother of sorrow, for the love of this Son, accept me for thy servant and pray for me. And Thou, my Redeemer, since Thou has died for me, permit me to love Thee; for I wish but thee and nothing more.</p> 

    

        <p>I love thee, Jesus, my love above all things; I repent with my whole heart for having often thee. Never permit me to separate myself from thee again. Grant that I may love thee always; and then do with me what thou will.</p>

        <p>Our father. 	</p> <p>			Hail Mary. 		</p> <p>	Glory be to the Father</p>

        <p>V.	Have mercy on us oh lord,</p> 
        <p>R.	Have Mercy on us,</p>
        <p>V.	May the souls of all the faithful departed </p>
        <p>R.	Through the Mercies of God, Rest in Peace</p>

        <p><i>By the cross with thee to stay,</i></p>
        <p><i>There with Thee to weep and pray</i></p>
        <p><i>Is all I ask of thee to give.</i></p>
