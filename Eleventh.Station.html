        <p>V.	We adore thee, O Christ, and we praise thee.</p>
        <p>R.	Because by thy holy cross Thou hast redeemed the world.</p>

        <p>Consider how Jesus, having been placed upon the cross, extended his hand and offer to his Eternal Father the sacrifice of His life for our salvation. Those barbarians fastened Him with nails, and then, securing the cross, allowed him to die with anguish on this infamous gibbet.</p>
        
        <p style="color: blue;">V.	Let us Kneel:</p>

        <p>My Jesus, loaded with contempt, nail my heart to thy feet, that it may ever remain there, to love you and never more to leave you.   </p>  

    

        <p>I love thee, Jesus, my love above all things;I repent with my whole heart for having often thee. Never permit me to separate myself from thee again. Grant that I may love thee always; and then do with me what thou will.</p>

        <p>Our father. 	</p> <p>			Hail Mary. 		</p> <p>	Glory be to the Father</p>

        <p>V.	Have mercy on us oh lord,</p> 
        <p>R.	Have Mercy on us,</p>
        <p>V.	May the souls of all the faithful departed </p>
        <p>R.	Through the Mercies of God, Rest in Peace</p>

        <p><i>Who for all my sins was slain</i></p>
        <p><i>Who for me in torments died</i></p>
