        <p>V.	We adore thee, O Christ, and we praise thee.</p>
        <p>R.	Because by thy holy cross Thou hast redeemed the world.</p>

        <p>Consider how Jesus in making this journey with his cross on his shoulders, thought of us and offer to his father, the death he was about to undergo.</p>
        
        <p style="color: blue;">V.	Let us Kneel:</p>

        <p>My most beloved Jesus, I embraced all the tribulations thou hast destined for me until death. I beseeched thee, by the merit of the pain you suffered in carrying your cross to give me the necessary help to carry mine with perfect patience and resignation.</p>

        <p>I love thee, Jesus, my love above all things; I repent with my whole heart for having often thee. Never permit me to separate myself from thee again. Grant that I may love thee always; and then do with me what thou will.</p>

        <p>Our father. 	Hail Mary. 	Glory be to the Father</p>

        <p>V.	Have mercy on us oh lord,</p> 
        <p>R.	Have Mercy on us,</p>
        <p>V.	May the souls of all the faithful departed </p>
        <p>R.	Through the Mercies of God, Rest in Peace</p>
