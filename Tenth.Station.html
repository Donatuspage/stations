        <p>V.	We adore thee, O Christ, and we praise thee.</p>
        <p>R.	Because by thy holy cross Thou hast redeemed the world.</p>

        <p>Consider the violence with which Jesus was stripped by his executioners. His inner garments adhered to His torn flesh, and they dragged them off so roughly that the skin came with them. Compassionate your savior thus cruelly treated.</p>
        
        <p style="color: blue;">V.	Let us Kneel:</p>

        <p>My most innocent Jesus, by the merits of the torment Thou has felt, help me to strip myself of all affection to the things of earth, that I may place all my love in Thee, who art so worthy of my love. </p> 

    

        <p>I love thee, Jesus, my love above all things;I repent with my whole heart for having often thee.Never permit me to separate myself from thee again. Grant that I may love thee always; and then do with me what thou will.</p>

        <p>Our father. 	</p> <p>			Hail Mary. 		</p> <p>	Glory be to the Father</p>

        <p>V.	Have mercy on us oh lord,</p> 
        <p>R.	Have Mercy on us,</p>
        <p>V.	May the souls of all the faithful departed </p>
        <p>R.	Through the Mercies of God, Rest in Peace</p>

        <p><i>In my heart each wound renew;</i></p>
        <p><i>Of my savior crucified.</i></p>
