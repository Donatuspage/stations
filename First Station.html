        <p>V.	We adore thee, O Christ, and we praise thee.</p>
        <p>R.	Because by thy holy cross Thou hast redeemed the world.</p>
        <p>Consider how Jesus, after having been scourged and crowned with thorns, was unjustly condemned by Pilate to die on the Cross.</p>
        
        <p style="color: blue;">V.	Let us Kneel:</p>

        <p>My loving Jesus, it was not Pilate; no, it was my sins that condemned thee to die. I beseech thee, by the merit of this sorrowful journey, assist my soul in her journey  towards eternity.</p>
        <p>I love thee, Jesus, my love above all things;I repent with my whole heart for having often thee. Never permit me to separate myself from thee again.Grant that I may love thee always; and then do with me what thou will.</p>

        <p>Our father. 	</p> <p>Hail Mary.</p> <p>Glory be to the Father</p>

        <p>V.	Have mercy on us oh lord,</p> 
        <p>R.	Have Mercy on us,</p>
        <p>V.	May the souls of all the faithful departed </p>
        <p>R.	Through the Mercies of God, Rest in Peace</p>

        <p><i>All his bitter anguish bearing,</i></p>
        <p><i>Now at length the sword had passed</i></p>
