        <h2>PRAYER BEFORE THE HIGH ALTER</h2>
        <p>O Jesus Christ, my Lord, with what great love did thou pass over the painful road which led thee to death; and I, how often have I abandoned thee! But now I love thee with my whole soul, and because I love thee I am sincerely sorry for having offended thee. My Jesus pardon me, and permit me to accompany thee in this journey. Thou art going to die for love of me, and it is my wish also, my dearest Redeemer, to die for love of thee. My Jesus, in thy love I wish to live, in thy love, I wish to die.</p>

        <p>V.	Have mercy on us Oh lord, </p>
        <p>R.	Have Mercy on us,</p>
        <p>V.	May the souls of all the faithful departed</p>
        <p>R.	Through the Mercies of God, Rest in Peace</p>

        <p><i>Stood the mournful Mother weeping</i></p>
        <p><i>Close to Jesus to the last</i></p>
