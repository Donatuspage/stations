        <p>V.	We adore thee, O Christ, and we praise thee.</p>
        <p>R.	Because by thy holy cross Thou hast redeemed the world.</p>

        <p>Consider how Jesus, being consumed with anguish after three hours of agony on the Cross, abandoned Himself to the wight of His body, bow his head and died.  </p> 
        
        <p style="color: blue;">V.	Let us Kneel:</p>

        <p>O my dying Jesus, I kiss devoutly the Cross on which you did die for love of me, I have merited by my sins to die a miserable death, but your death is my hope. By the merit of your death, give me grace to die embracing your feet and burning with love for you, I commit my soul into your hands. </p>

    

        <p>I love thee, Jesus, my love above all things; I repent with my whole heart for having often thee. Never permit me to separate myself from thee again. Grant that I may love thee always; and then do with me what thou will.</p>

        <p>Our father. 	</p> <p>			Hail Mary. 		</p> <p>	Glory be to the Father</p>

        <p>V.	Have mercy on us oh lord,</p> 
        <p>R.	Have Mercy on us,</p>
        <p>V.	May the souls of all the faithful departed </p>
        <p>R.	Through the Mercies of God, Rest in Peace</p>

        <p><i>All the days that I may live.</i></p>
