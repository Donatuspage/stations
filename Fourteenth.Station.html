        <p>V.	We adore thee, O Christ, and we praise thee.</p>
        <p>R.	Because by thy holy cross Thou hast redeemed the world.</p>

        <p>Consider how the disciples, accompanied by His holy mother, carried the body of Jesus to bury it. They close the tomb, and all came sorrowfully away. </p> 
        
        <p style="color: blue;">V.	Let us Kneel:</p>

        <p>My buried Jesus, I kiss the stone that encloses thee, But thou did rise again on the third day, I beseeched thee by thy resurrection , to make me rise in glory with thee at the last day, to be always united with thee in heaven, to praise Thee and love Thee forever.</p>

    

        <p>I love thee, Jesus, my love above all things; I repent with my whole heart for having often thee. Never permit me to separate myself from thee again. Grant that I may love thee always; and then do with me what thou will.</p>

        <p>Our father. 	</p> <p>			Hail Mary. 		</p> <p>	Glory be to the Father</p>

        <p>V.	Have mercy on us oh lord,</p> 
        <p>R.	Have Mercy on us,</p>
        <p>V.	May the souls of all the faithful departed </p>
        <p>R.	Through the Mercies of God, Rest in Peace</p>

        <p><i>There with Thee to weep and pray</i></p>
        <p><i>Is all I ask of thee to give.</i></p>
