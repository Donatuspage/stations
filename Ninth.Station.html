        <p>V.	We adore thee, O Christ, and we praise thee.</p>
        <p>R.	Because by thy holy cross Thou hast redeemed the world.</p>

        <p>Consider the third fall of Jesus Christ. His weakness was extreme and the cruelty of his executioners excessive,who tried to hasten His step when He could scarcely move.</p> 
        
        <p style="color: blue;">V.	Let us Kneel:</p>

        <p>My outraged Jesus, by the merits of the merits of the weakness Thou did suffer in going to Calvary, give me strength to conquer all human respect, and my wicket passions, which have led me to despise Thy friendship.  </p> 

    

        <p>I love thee, Jesus, my love above all things; I repent with my whole heart for having often thee. Never permit me to separate myself from thee again. Grant that I may love thee always; and then do with me what thou will.</p>

        <p>Our father. 	</p> <p>			Hail Mary. 		</p> <p>	Glory be to the Father</p>

        <p>V.	Have mercy on us oh lord,</p> 
        <p>R.	Have Mercy on us,</p>
        <p>V.	May the souls of all the faithful departed </p>
        <p>R.	Through the Mercies of God, Rest in Peace</p>

        <p><i>Make me feel as thou has felt;</i></p>
        <p><i>Make my soul to glow and melt;</i></p>
        <p><i>With the love of Christ my lord.</i></p>
