        <p>V.	We adore thee, O Christ, and we praise thee.</p>
        <p>R.	Because by thy holy cross Thou hast redeemed the world.</p>

        <p>Consider how his cruel tormentors, seeing Jesus was on the point of expiring, and fearing he would die on the way, whereas they wished him to die the shameful death of the cross, constrained Simon of Cyrene to carry the cross behind our Lord.  </p>
        
        <p style="color: blue;">V.	Let us Kneel:</p>

        <p>My most beloved Jesus, by thy grace I will not refuse to carry the cross; I accept it, I embrace it. I accept in particular the death thou has destined for me, with all the pains which may accompany it; I unite it to thy death, I offer it to thee, thou has died for </p>
        <p>love of me; I will die for love of you, help by thy grace.</p>

        <p>I love thee, Jesus, my love above all things; I repent with my whole heart for having often thee. Never permit me to separate myself from thee again. Grant that I may love thee always; and then do with me what thou will.</p>

        <p>Our father. 	</p> <p>			Hail Mary. 		</p> <p>	Glory be to the Father</p>

        <p>V.	Have mercy on us oh lord,</p> 
        <p>R.	Have Mercy on us,</p>
        <p>V.	May the souls of all the faithful departed </p>
        <p>R.	Through the Mercies of God, Rest in Peace</p>
